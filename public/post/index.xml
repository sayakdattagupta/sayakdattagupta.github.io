      <description>RSS (&amp;lsquo;Really Simple Syndication&amp;rsquo;) feeds are an excellent way to stay up-to-date with recent posts on a website that supports them. Basically, think of it as a newsletter or notifier, but without the bloat, and with the added advantage of (usually) being able to read the said article in it&amp;rsquo;s entirety. To get started with &amp;ldquo;subscribing&amp;rdquo; to RSS feeds, you simply need a RSS reader. I recommend Feeder (I would prefer you use F-Droid, or Droidify, to install it, instead of the Play Store) on Android.</description>

      <description>NewPipe is a libre (Free, with a capitalized &amp;lsquo;F&amp;rsquo;) frontend for YouTube which runs on Android devices.
The inconvenience, data collection, and speed issues of YouTube had bothered me for quite a while before I finally decided to switch to an open-source, preferably Free, alternative. It does have a trending tab, though, and the last time I checked, it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be turned off. However, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a huge issue since recurring MrBeast content isn&amp;rsquo;t very tempting anyway.</description>
