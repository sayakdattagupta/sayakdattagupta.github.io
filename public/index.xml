      <description>Mock tests are a global phenomenon. Every student — from American AP Physics 2 bros to Chinese Gaokao tryhards to Indian JEE Advanced sweats — takes them. And they usually cost a pretty penny.
Breaking Bad the mock examinations cartel. Not anymore.
Goodbye legacy, propeitary, limited-in-scope-and-content test taking software. Welcome LibrExam. Welcome its AGPL-3 License (I am looking at you, Microsoft*).
The fundamental idea behind LibrExam is that it&amp;rsquo;s kind of decentralised.</description>

      <description>RSS (&amp;lsquo;Really Simple Syndication&amp;rsquo;) feeds are an excellent way to stay up-to-date with recent posts on a website that supports them. Basically, think of it as a newsletter or notifier, but without the bloat, and with the added advantage of (usually) being able to read the said article in it&amp;rsquo;s entirety. To get started with &amp;ldquo;subscribing&amp;rdquo; to RSS feeds, you simply need a RSS reader. I recommend Feeder (I would prefer you use F-Droid, or Droidify, to install it, instead of the Play Store) on Android.</description>

      <title>Shun YouTube on Android, use NewPipe</title>

      <description>NewPipe is a libre (Free, with a capitalized &amp;lsquo;F&amp;rsquo;) frontend for YouTube which runs on Android devices.
The inconvenience, data collection, and speed issues of YouTube had bothered me for quite a while before I finally decided to switch to an open-source, preferably Free, alternative. It does have a trending tab, though, and the last time I checked, it couldn&amp;rsquo;t be turned off. However, this isn&amp;rsquo;t a huge issue since recurring MrBeast content isn&amp;rsquo;t very tempting anyway.</description>

      <description>I like writing useful programs, peddling FOSS, anything mechanical, working-out (calisthenics, for the time being), making music, consooming movies, and being opinionated.
The following is pulled from my Linkedin:
I am a high school senior and a part-time amateur programmer with skills in Unity Game Engine (C#), C with SDL, Python, and more. I have a decent understanding of x86 Assembly (ASM) and am comfortable using Linux, having &amp;ldquo;daily-ed&amp;rdquo; an Arch install and using Kali Linux&amp;rsquo;s pentesting suite.</description>
