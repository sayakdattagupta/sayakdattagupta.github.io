RSS ('Really Simple Syndication') feeds are an excellent way to stay up-to-date with recent posts on a website that supports them. Basically, think of it as a newsletter or notifier, but without the bloat, and with the added advantage of (usually) being able to read the said article in it's entirety.

To get started with "subscribing" to RSS feeds, you simply need a RSS reader. I recommend [Feeder](https://github.com/spacecowboy/Feeder) (I would prefer you use F-Droid, or Droidify, to install it, instead of the Play Store) on Android.<br>

Open the app, and simply add the feed link. It's `https://sayakdattagupta.github.io/index.xml` for my site. Most sites (including mine) which have a subscription button/rss icon directly link you to the `.xml` file, since browsers can read these files. Don't get confused and simply copy this link into the reader.

The beauty about this system is you aren't connected to some bloated, spyware-esque annoying mailing list. It is 100% local and pulls in content whenever you want to. It even supports images!
