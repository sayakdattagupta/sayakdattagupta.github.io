Mock tests are a global phenomenon. Every student — from American AP Physics 2 bros to Chinese Gaokao tryhards to Indian JEE Advanced sweats — takes them. And they usually cost a pretty penny.

Not anymore.

Goodbye legacy, propeitary, limited-in-scope-and-content test taking software. Welcome [LibrExam](https://github.com/sayakdattagupta/librexam). Welcome its AGPL-3 License (I am looking at you, Microsoft\*).

The fundamental idea behind LibrExam is that it's kind of decentralised. Obviously, using GitHub as a content-sharing-system, though novel, makes it centralised - but users always have the ability to share the JSON (yes, tests are written out in JSONs) file of their test; Moving away from third-party or self-hosted images is a different issue, however - I am still yet to figure that out (LibrExam is very, VERY much in alpha)

Now, to be absolutely honest, I had toyed with this LibrExam idea for quite a while before finally starting to work on it—mostly because competitive examinations had been taking the lion's share of my blood pressure (bad), the preparation for which had made me use several proprietary quiz platforms (torture).

Safe to say: All of those platforms are coming down.
