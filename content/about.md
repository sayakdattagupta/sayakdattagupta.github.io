title: About Me

I like writing _useful_ programs, peddling FOSS, anything mechanical, working-out, making music, consooming movies, and being opinionated.

**This site is made in Hugo, using the theme hugo-xmin. It has further been tastefully modified by me â€“ it now has a dark color theme, a different article layout, and it incorporates responsiveness, a reading list, and a movie-watching list that loads from a JSON (I have not included the Python script that generates it in my source). I might release this as a separate theme pretty soon.**
