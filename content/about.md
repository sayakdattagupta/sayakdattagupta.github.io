Hi, I am **Sayak Dattagupta**, and I am currently a 12th grader who is passionate about programming, mathematics, physics and problem solving in general. This is my blog, which I have set up using Hugo and Github Pages (so as to bypass any hosting costs). The theme that I have used is [hugo-xmin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin), which has LaTeX supoort right out of the gate (as demonstrated in the homepage) and is extremely light (150 lines). I cannot recommend it enough.
