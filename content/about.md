title: About Me
---

I like writing _useful_ programs, peddling FOSS, anything mechanical, working-out, making music, "consooming" movies, and being opinionated.

## About this Site

This site is made in [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), using the theme hugo-xmin. It has further been tastefully modified by me â€“ it now has a dark color theme, a different article layout, and responsiveness.  I might release this as a separate theme pretty soon.
