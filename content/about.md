title: About Me
---

I like writing _useful_ programs, peddling FOSS, anything mechanical, working-out (calisthenics, for the time being), making music, consooming movies, and being opinionated.

**The following is pulled from my Linkedin:**

I am a high school senior and a part-time amateur programmer with skills in Unity Game Engine (C#), C with SDL, Python, and more. I have a decent understanding of x86 Assembly (ASM) and am comfortable using Linux, having "daily-ed" an Arch install and using Kali Linux's pentesting suite. I also have experience with Adobe Premiere Pro, Photoshop, and Blender.

Debating has always sparked my interest, and I’ve been an active member of the Senior School Debate Club. I’ve delivered multiple presentations on science and engineering topics, such as Cold Fusion Theory and ICE (Otto and Atkinson Cycles), making me somewhat of a science educator in the process.

Currently, I’m interested in pursuing my undergraduate studies in mechanical or aerospace engineering.

**This site is made in Hugo, using the theme hugo-xmin. It has further been tastefully modified by me – it now has a dark color theme, a different article layout, and it incorporates responsiveness, a reading list, and a movie-watching list that loads from a JSON (I have not included the Python script that generates it in my source). I might release this as a separate theme pretty soon.**
