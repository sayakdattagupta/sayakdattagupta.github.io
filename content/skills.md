Here are some things that I know.

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Programming Languages</h2>

- C (SDL2)
- C++ (SFML, SDL2)
- C# (for Unity)
- JavaScript (pure, vue)
- Java (only upto the level taught at high school)
- Python (matplotlib, numpy, scipy, selenium, geckodriver, flask, Tkinter)
- Bash
- HTML and CSS (no frameworks)

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Tools & Systems</h2>

I practically only use a desktop Linux setup (Debian/Arch + i3/dwm) these days and can get along with it just fine, but I will refrain from calling Linux to be a "skill" of mine since I have no proper knowledge about things like kernel programming, yet.

Also, just because I can _make_ video games (I haven't developed any in a long time) does not mean I actively _play_ video games anymore.

- Jupyter Notebooks
- git
- GitHub (Pages, Workflows)
- Unity Game Engine
- Vercel
- Vue.js
- flask
- Vite
- Hugo
- VirtualBox

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Others</h2>

When I list something like GIMP here, I mean that I can find my way around the tool â€” not that I can draw well or make objectively good art.

- Premiere Pro
- Illustrator
- GIMP
- Olive (Video Editor)
- FL Studio
- Reaper
- Audacity
- GarageBand
- Photoshop
- Photopea
